				<h2>Inkscape and Fusion360 - 2D and 3D modelings</h2>
				<p>This project aims to create two models, one of them is 2D, which I will create on Inkscape, and the other model is 3D, which I will create with Fusion 360.</p>

				<h3>Inkscape - 2D modeling</h3>
				<p>In this form, I will try to design my own logo, which contains the first three letters of my first, middle and last name (I.J.T)</p>
				<p>In the first step, I drew the letters in a large size and added two dots between them</p>
				<img src="photo/ink3.jpg" alt="step3">
				<p>After that, I colored the letters in a blue gradient color.</p>

				<h3>Fusion360 - 3D modeling</h3>
				<p>3D design programs are many and complex, but unfortunately I have not worked on any of them before. This is the first time that I try to design a 3D model,
					so I will try to design a simple and uncomplicated model.</p>
				<p>Often times when I try to watch a movie or fottball match on my mobile phone, I find it difficult to stabilize the phone on the table. So that it fits 
					within my field of vision. So I thought to design a portable phone holder. I found some ready-made models on the internet, but I wanted to design an 
					alternative model so that I could control the angle of inclination of the phone. </p>
				<p>First, create a rectangular base that is 7 mm high. And I added four protrusions to it to stabilize the angle of inclination.</p>
				<img src="photo/fusion1.jpg" alt="step1">
				<p>In the second step, I created a pivot attached to the base to make it easy to move the legs on which the phone will rest.</p>
				<img src="photo/fusion2.jpg" alt="step2">
				<p>In the third step, I created moving legs on the axis that we created in the previous step, which will support the phone</p>
				<img src="photo/fusion3.jpg" alt="step3">
				<p>In this step, I created a third foot, which will control the inclination of the mobile phone. All the legs will be connected to each other by a pivot 
					on the top in this way</p>
				<img src="photo/fusion4.jpg" alt="step4">
				<p>In the end, I created a box in the shape of a mobile phone and put it in its designated place</p>
